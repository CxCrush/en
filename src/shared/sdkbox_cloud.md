### SDKBOX Cloud
SDKBOX Cloud enables developers to receive the benefits of a centralized application management interface, that helps to provide leverage their applications with extended functionality. The two main features are: __Remote Application Management__ which provides the abilities of updating and testing, and __IAP Receipt Verification__.

Developers must register at Chukongâ€™s website to get __developers credentials__. After receiving __developers credentials__, developers can register an unlimited number of __applications__. Each __application__ will have an associated __application token__ and a __cyphering key__. These are used to securely transmit new plugin configurations to the clients as well as grant access to all the remotely accessible services.
